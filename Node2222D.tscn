text = "There are many explanations as to why the curling stone curls. The most common explanation is the uneven distribution of friction. Once
the stone is thrown, it is slightly tilted forward because of friction. This increases the pressure at the front, and increases the normal 
force at the front. The normal force melts a thin layer of the ice whihc creates a lubricant and reduces the friction. Since there is a higher
normal force at the front, there is more ice melted at the front. Due to the rotation, the water is also spread around, and since there is 
more ice melted at the front, the force of friction is different at different parts of the running band. This makes the stone curl in the same 
direction as the rotation."
